Create new scene
	supply string
	string = LUA scripting file
	generic scene is initialised with reference to system + LUA file name
	generic scene calls similarly structured LUA functions
	Lua functions call C++ code via luabind


The upshot of this is that it means scene can be a generic class

Message queue loop?

while(running) {
     //Read in all the events from the queue
     while(eventQueue.hasNext()) { //While there are more events on the queue..
          Event e = eventQueue.pop(); //Get the event
          if(e.type == mouseClick) { //Check the event
               //Whatever logic here
          }
     }
